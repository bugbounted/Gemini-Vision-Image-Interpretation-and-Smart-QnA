#GenAI App -> Gemini Vision: Image Interpretation and Smart Q&A

Sample Use Cases:

Users can upload any image and ask following questions:

        "Identify Image",
        "Transcribe Image",
        "Write Blog for Image",
        "Provide food recipe for Image",
        "Calculate approx. calories for food Image"

ðŸš€ Unlocking the Power of Generative AI with Google Gemini and Streamlit! ðŸš€

I'm excited to share that I've successfully developed an AI-powered web app that blends the capabilities of Google Geminiâ€™s Vision Model with Streamlit to provide interactive image analysis and Q&A functionalities! ðŸ’«

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features:

Technologies Used: Streamlit for the frontend, and Google Gemini's Vision Model (1.5 Flash) for AI-powered content generation.

Image & Text Input: Users can upload images (.jpg, .jpeg, .png) and submit text prompts to generate insightful responses.

Smart Content Generation: The model interprets both the image and text prompt, providing descriptive content or answering questions about the image.

Special Character Handling: Custom handling of special characters like $ ensures a seamless UI experience without breaking the flow of the output.

How it Works:

Users upload an image and input a question or prompt via a simple, user-friendly interface.

The app passes the inputs to the Google Gemini Vision API, which processes the image and text to generate detailed, context-aware responses.

Responses are dynamically displayed on the screen, creating an interactive and intuitive user experience.

Why this Matters:

This project demonstrates how easy-to-use platforms like Streamlit can harness the power of Generative AI models like Google Gemini to deliver smart, interactive solutions. It's an exciting step forward in making AI more accessible to users while pushing the boundaries of image understanding and natural language processing!
